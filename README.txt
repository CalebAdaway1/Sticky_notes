Please see latest Django project - I have followed the workshops and used the guides provided 
in the feedback. I have also used ChatGPT to create the following project 

Due to the date I am hoping I can get some feedback on what I have uploaded - I understand the support ends
on the 30th so I am unsure of how I will be implement feedback after this but I feel as if 
I have done what I can  

30/06 

I have added comments to view.py and I have created a urls.py into the main notes directory 

I have added changes to the Use case diagram along with the Sequence diagram 

The changes I have made to the diagrams is minimal as I have now run out of time 
I honestly do not think I can add a huge amount more to this piece of work 
I really have struggled with this project, This task is much more complicated than other work I have completed
